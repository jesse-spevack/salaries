An application for anonymously sharing salary information within the Turing community.

## Visit Salaries
Salaries is currently viewable at [https://secret-earth-99752.herokuapp.com/](https://secret-earth-99752.herokuapp.com/)

## Project Road Map
We are currently working to produce an MVP defined [here](https://github.com/jesse-spevack/salaries/projects/1)

Subsequent projects will be scoped to give users the ability to submit granular demographic, job title, industry and company information as well as the ability to view salary data by each of those indicators.
